## JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
Collection of classic (and maybe not-so-classic) computer science algorithms and data structures implemented in JavaScript.

#### Purpose
I am using this codebase for fun and practice.  Although there are tests for all implementations, I would not suggest it for production use as of now.

#### How To Run
This is a simple project with few dependencies.  Once cloned, run `npm install` then `npm run test` to see tests in action.
